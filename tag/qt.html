  <div class="entry-content"> <p>I'm currently updating a commercial HTML-based desktop application that I wrote a few years ago. Customers keep having permissions trouble on Windows with the back-end opening a TCP port for serving front-end's HTTP requests. I decided to try to refresh both the back-end (to Jetty 7.3.0) and the front-end (to WebKit running in Java via Qt Jambi) and run them in one process with no TCP ports involved. Both components have reputations for being easy to embed, so I thought it shouldn't be too hard. Yeah right...</p>
<p>Actually, things went very smoothly at first. Here's what I discovered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jetty accepts requests via Connectors; one of them is LocalConnector.</li>
<li>Obviously, setting up Jetty with LocalConnector is beyond the scope of this post :-)</li>
<li>LocalConnector.getResponses() accepts a String argument containing an HTTP request just as you would type it into a telnet window (like "GET /whatever HTTP/1.0" followed by two newlines) and returns an HTTP response, also as a String ("HTTP/200 OK blah blah..."). It's a primitive interface but it does work.</li>
<li>The method mentioned above doesn't work very well if you want to GET binary data such as images (yeah, you could use "Content-Encoding: base64" but come on...). There is, fortunately, a variant of LocalConnector.getResponses() that accepts a ByteArrayBuffer along with a boolean "keepOpen" argument which I simply set to false. The method otherwise works just like the String variant.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for a WebKit front-end, once you have Qt Jambi set up properly (with -Djava.library.path etc.) it's really easy to create a QWebView, point it at a URL and splash it all over your display. To prevent HTTP traffic, however, I needed to intercept requests coming from WebKit and route them to my LocalConnector:</p>
<ul>
<li>The thing to do is QWebView.page().setNetworkAccessManager(magic), where "magic" is a subclass of QNetworkAccessManager that overrides createRequest() to do the necessary, well, magic.</li>
<li>Despite superficial appearances, createRequest() actually accepts QNetworkRequest as a parameter and returns a QNetworkReply. Go figure. Additional parameters for createRequest() include an Operation enum to distinguish GETs from POSTs, and a QIODevice (think InputStream) containing the data of a POST request.</li>
<li>Since QNetworkReply is also a stream-like QIODevice, returning custom content from createRequest() involves writing a QNetworkReply subclass that knows where to look for when clients call its read*() methods. This is not quite easy to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway. After a few hours I had a web application running in a WebKit window with not a TCP packet in sight.The trouble came when I tried to process a POST request (yes, the application does involve filling out forms). What followed was a bout of frustration, head-scratching and just plain unhappiness that I don't wish upon anyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you have to realize that Qt Jambi (including its WebKit component) is actually a C++ beast in sheep-like Java clothing. No matter how sweet the API is, the implementation is a bitch to debug even if, technically, you have access to the source code.</li>
<li>What happened is that my createRequest() was called with a PostOperation as it should be but the accompanying QIODevice was empty. More specifically, calling canReadLine() on it returned false.</li>
<li>Setting a breakpoint and examining the QIODevice's internals didn't show anything interesting (it was basically a proxy object for a C++ implementation).</li>
<li>I resorted to the oldest tool in a programmer's toolbox: trace statements. Here's what they gave me:<ul>
<li>formData.isOpen(): true</li>
<li>formData.isReadable(): true</li>
<li>formData.isSequential(): true</li>
<li>formData.atEnd(): true</li>
<li>formData.bytesAvailable(): 0</li>
<li>formData.size(): 0</li>
<li>formData.pos(): 0</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried routing regular HTTP post requests through the parent class and it worked even though the request objects looked exactly the same and returned exactly the same trace results! I was getting ready to give my own QNetworkRequest to the parent implementation that would trace all calls made to it but I tried getByte() and... there was data! WTF?! Point: QNetworkRequest was in a weird uninitialized state where it thought it was empty when it really wasn't. It snapped out of it when prodded for data.</p>
<p>Another problem surfaced when I tried to get a Dojo Tree widget going. During initialization, Dojo loads its modules via AJAX and it was failing with the dreaded "NETWORK_ERR: XmlHttpRequest Exception 101". Cost me a lot of blind paths - I tried setting the .js files in different paths relative to the referring .jsp, reading compressed Dojo sources, diagnosing with window.alert() etc. In the end, I understood that WebKit was having some problem with the QNetworkReply I was producing. I made my Content-Length calculation more robust - no change. Finally, I looked at QNetworkReply objects produced by the regular QNetworkAccessManager and made sure all the attributes it fills out were also filled out in my replies. That helped. I know, I should have done it at the start but why did it matter with AJAX requests and not with regular ones? Oh well...</p>
<p>The AJAX issue turned out to be the last major obstacle. My application now runs without opening any TCP ports and both WebKit and Jetty proved reasonably embeddable. I might use this set-up in other contexts as well.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
