  <div class="entry-content"> <p>In <a href="../the-battle-of-the-c5280-part-1.html">part 1</a> and <a href="../the-battle-of-the-c5280-part-2.html">part 2</a> I describe how I got CUPS to recognize my printer. Alas, the battle was far from over: it still refused to print. Back in <em>/var/log/cups/error_log</em> I found</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">libusb</span> <span class="n">write</span> <span class="n">operation</span> <span class="n">returned</span> <span class="n">fffffff4</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Of course, fffffff4 translates to -12 which translates to <em>LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</em>. More trace statements were in order.</p>
<p>From the surrounding log messages I figured out that the error was returned from <em>obsd_submit_transfer</em> in <em>openbsd_usb.c</em>. I found all places in that function where the error could have been returned and equipped them with traces. The culprit turned out to be one level deeper, in <em>_sync_gen_transfer</em>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dpriv</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">devname</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>By now my round-trip was quite masochistic:</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit openbsd_usb.c as patched by the port.</li>
<li>Make a new patch.</li>
<li>Replace the port's patch with the new one.</li>
<li>Rebuild port.</li>
<li>Stop CUPS.</li>
<li>Uninstall libusb and CUPS (CUPS depends on libusb).</li>
<li>Install libusb from the port.</li>
<li>Install CUPS.</li>
<li>Start CUPS.</li>
<li>Try something.</li>
<li>See what turns up in the log.</li>
</ol>
<p>I did have a script for steps 2 through 9 but now I needed to find out how <em>NULL</em> got into <em>dpriv-&gt;devname</em>. I realized it was time to learn <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=gdb">gdb</a> - the GNU interactive debugger.</p>
<p>If you click on that link you will find a typical OpenBSD man page: clear, succint, to the point (I've said this before: documentation is the most impressive thing about OpenBSD, by far). Figuring out how to compile libusb with debugging symbols was another stumbling block, however. The line <em>.ifdef DEBUG</em> in the port's <em>Makefile</em> had given me a mistaken impression that the value of <em>DEBUG</em> didn't matter. I put <em>DEBUG=1</em> into <em>/etc/mk.conf</em> and libusb promptly stopped building, with <em>configure</em> saying something to the effect that CC was unable to generate an executable. Rummaging throug <em>configure.log</em>, the incriminating lines looked approximately like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">cc</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">O2</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">pipe</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">conftest</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">c</span>
<span class="nl">cc:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">No</span> <span class="n">such</span> <span class="n">file</span> <span class="n">or</span> <span class="n">directory</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Silly me thought the first "1" was a parameter for the "-pipe" option while the other "1" was a line number. Once I put one and one together (ahem), <em>man cc</em> told me <em>DEBUG</em> should be <em>-g</em>, obviously, after which <em>make clean build</em> produced a file 100K bigger than before, pregnant with debugging wisdom. I was happy.</p>
<p>Having conquered the last obstacle, I was stepping through my toy program in no time. I even found the multi-window ncurses-based TUI (text user interface) although that wasn't mentioned in the man page. One irritating thing about TUI was that it didn't have the debbuged program's standard streams under control. Each time a trace statement was printed it blew up the layout. I finally turned it off by running gdb with <em>-tty=/dev/null</em> which wasn't ideal either but it was an improvement. To be frank, I would expect TUI to have a dedicated console window to handle the program's I/O. Alas, that doesn't seem to be the case.</p>
<p>The source seemed to be somewhat out of sync with the code being executed ("next" kept jumping back and forth, gdb itself would segfault once I launched the program a few times). I ascribed this to optimizations performed by CC so I turned them off by saying <em>CFLAGS=-O0 -g</em> in the port's <em>Makefile</em> and rebuilding (the <em>-g</em> was necessary because apparently <em>CFLAGS</em> in the <em>Makefile</em> overrides <em>CFLAGS</em> assembled by other means). To my surprise, it did help - stepping became perfectly smooth from then on.</p>
<p>Of course, gdb only took me deeper into the mystery. <em>Continued in <a href="../the-battle-of-the-c5280-part-4.html">part 4</a>.</em></p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

  <div class="entry-content"> <p>I ended <a href="../the-battle-of-the-c5280-part-1.html">part 1</a> with a description of my struggles to display trace statements inserted into libusb. One spot where I needed to add a trace was</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">fd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">busnode</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">O_RDWR</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">continue</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that the code here keeps a rather important detail (errno) to itself. I changed the code to</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">fd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">busnode</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">O_RDWR</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">errno</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">ENOENT</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">errno</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">ENXIO</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">usbi_err</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ctx</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;could not open %s&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">busnode</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="n">fprintf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stderr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;errno: %d&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">errno</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">continue</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and once the output started flowing I found out that errno was 13 (EACCESS). A classic file permissions problem, it's just that it wasn't very well reported. It should have been apparent back when I saw the backend work without problems when run directly.</p>
<p>Rather than figuring out which user's permissions are in effect when CUPS calls the backend, I simply turned on global read-write permissions for <em>/dev/ugen*</em> to see if it would help. It didn't.</p>
<p>After another bit of "fun" detective work, I found the reason buried in the libusb port. For those unfamiliar with OpenBSD ports, a port is basically a recipe for turning an external piece of software into an OpenBSD package. It contains instructions for fetching and unpacking the source, patching it for OpenBSD, building it, packaging the result in a neat <em>.tgz</em> file and even installing an unistalling it.</p>
<p>I noticed that the patch for <em>openbsd_usb.c</em> was rather big - almost 18K. On closer look, it was a substantial rewrite of the whole file which was kind of unexpected since the original code was already supposed to be OpenBSD-specific. One thing the rewrite changed was that it was no longer iterating over <em>/dev/ugen<em><em> but rather over </em>/dev/usb</em></em>. I failed to notice it when inserting trace statements - the pattern had been extracted into constants at the start of the file.</p>
<p>Armed with new wisdom, I turned on global read-write permissions for <em>/dev/usb*</em>. <strong>Progress! CUPS finally found my printer.</strong> I clicked on "Print test page". As you may have guessed, nothing happened. <em>Continued in <a href="../the-battle-of-the-c5280-part-3.html">part 3</a>.</em></p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

  <div class="entry-content"> <p>The other day I posted a <a href="../alice-in-printerland.html">frustrated rant</a> about my troubles getting the printer to work under OpenBSD. This has evolved into a massive struggle which is still ongoing. On the one hand, it's ridiculous how much time I'm devoting to this. On the other, I've dusted off my C chops, built basic proficiency with gdb and discovered a bunch of curious facts about OpenBSD and USB which I'll probably never use again and forget in a matter of weeks. So it's perhaps worth writing some of them down.</p>
<p>First, a bit of background. My home server runs on OpenBSD. One of its duties is providing access to a HP Photosmart C5280 printer via CUPS and it works like a charm. The version of OpenBSD I'm running is getting old, however, so I've purchased the 5.2 CD set and I'm setting it up on another machine.</p>
<p>Everything went well until I tried to add the printer via CUPS' web interface. No local connection was detected. I turned on extra logging (by saying <em>LogLevel debug</em> in <em>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</em>), clicked around in the web UI and found this in <em>/var/log/cups/error_log</em>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">libusb_get_device_list</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It looked like libusb was having trouble finding the printer. I looked up libusb <a href="http://www.libusb.org">on the web</a>, looked at the source code and confirmed my suspicion. I also found out there was an OpenBSD-specific file (<a href="http://www.libusb.org/browser/libusb/libusb/os/openbsd_usb.c">openbsd_usb.c</a>) which looked for <em>/dev/ugen*</em> devices. Those were present on my system in abundance, so a missing device wasn't a problem.</p>
<p>The error log also mentioned <em>/usr/local/libexec/cups/backend/usb</em> and browsing CUPS help gave me a hint of what <a href="http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/man-backend.html">backends</a> were about. So I ran the USB backend directly on the command line. To my surprise, it had no problem finding the device. Something was wrong in the way CUPS was calling the backend.</p>
<p><a id="test"></a>I decided to <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html#Ports">set up OpenBSD ports</a> and compile libusb with some trace statements. I wrote a minimal program to test things:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="cp">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">#include &lt;libusb.h&gt;</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">libusb_device</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">list</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">count</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="n">fprintf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stdout</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Devices: %d</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">count</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">libusb_free_device_list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">list</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">libusb_exit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I hadn't done C hacking in a while so I spent a fair amount of time just crafting the proper <em>cc</em> command line but eventually I could read a nice "Devices: 7" in the output. I then started sprinkling trace statements over libusb. I naively thought using <em>fprintf(stderr, ...)</em> would be easier than figuring out how to activate the existing logging functions (<em>usbi_warn</em>, <em>usbi_dbg</em> etc.). No matter what I did, the traces wouldn't show up. Eventually I did activate libusb's logging (commenting out <em>.ifdef DEBUG</em> in the port's <em>Makefile</em>). Didn't help.</p>
<p>After much wailing and gnashing of teeth, it turned out it was a linking problem. I'd trusted <em>cc</em> would link the library statically by default (I have no idea how to override the default anyway). The bastard used dynamic linking instead which meant that upon running the program I was talking to <em>/usr/local/lib/libusb-1.0.so.1.0</em> from the installed libusb package. Running with</p>

  <div class="entry-content"> <p>I've just spent about 12 hours trying to set up CUPS on my OpenBSD home server, with no success. The USB backend didn't want to recognize the local printer. After setting up OpenBSD ports, inserting trace statements into libusb sources and forcing ld to talk to the newly compiled library instead of the one from the standard package, I found out that the backend stumbled on "Permission denied". I made the /dev entries global-readable and -writable to see if it would help. The printer was recognized and I could install it properly.</p>
<p>Then I tried printing a test page and LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS became LIBUSB_ERROR_OTHER.</p>
<p>There are 13 places in libusb where the _OTHER could come from and I have lost the will to see where the rabbit hole leads. Time for a fresh start.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

  <div class="entry-content"> <p>As I work to fix timezone logic in <a href="https://github.com/codingjourney/upsheet">upsheet</a>, I've become somewhat frustrated with date and time handling in Python. Coming from a Java background, I know this stuff is awfully difficult to get right. Python has a large community driven by sophisticated users, however, so I expected things to be pretty smooth. I was wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>datetime</em> vs. <em>time</em></strong>
Two modules with overlapping functionality and no clear separation of scope.</li>
<li><strong><em>datetime.datetime</em></strong>
A class with the same name as its module. This is probably common in the Python library but it makes for weird expressions such as <em>datetime.datetime.strptime(...)</em>. Kind of nudges you to drop the module prefix with <em>from datetime import *</em>.</li>
<li><strong>timezone handling in <em>datetime</em> is a red-headed stepchild</strong>
The <em>datetime</em> module tactfully avoids the gritty details of coming up with the local system's current timezone. You can supply a timezone but you have to provide your own <em>tzinfo</em> subclass to do it.</li>
<li><strong>timezone handling in <em>time</em> is a red-headed stepchild</strong>
You get <em>timezone</em> for the non-DST system timezone, <em>altzone</em> for the DST system timezone, <em>daylight</em> to see if <em>altzone</em> is even applicable and <em>localtime().tm_isdst</em> to decide (provided <em>altzone</em> is applicable) whether <em>timezone</em> or <em>altzone</em> is the local system's current timezone. Whew! I mean, it's wonderfully precise and flexible but kind of all over the place.</li>
<li><strong>timezone offsets are represented inconsistently</strong>
While <em>datetime.tzinfo.utcoffset()</em> must return its result in minutes, both <em>time.timezone</em> and <em>time.altzone</em> provide the offset in seconds. Trivial yet irritating.</li>
<li><strong><em>datetime.time</em> vs. <em>time</em></strong>
A class in one module with the same name as a related module. When you use <em>datetime</em> without the module prefix, this forces you to either also use <em>time</em> without the prefix - further polluting the naming scope - or alias it using <em>import time as sillytime</em>.</li>
<li><strong>inconsistent timezone offsets</strong>
While <em>time.timezone</em> and <em>time.altzone</em> specify timezone offsets in seconds west of UTC, <em>tzinfo.utcoffset()</em> must return minutes east of UTC.</li>
<li><strong>mischievous documentation</strong>
One example: the description of <em>struct_time.tm_isdst</em> says <em>"0, 1 or -1; see below"</em>. Of course, there's no further mention of <em>tm_isdst</em> anywhere in the document. A sentence buried in the next paragraph does say <em>"A -1 argument as the daylight savings flag, passed to mktime() will usually result in the correct daylight savings state to be filled in."</em>. Which means the -1 is utterly irrelevant except for one specific use-case.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having figured all of this out, I can now construct a <em>datetime.datetime</em> instance equipped with the correct <em>tzinfo</em> for the current local timezone. This goes to show how hard it is to design a really good API.</p>
<p>I do hope it all works the same way under Windows...</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

  <div class="entry-content"> <p>My <a href="https://github.com/codingjourney/upsheet">timesheet uploader</a> micro-project started off as a spontaneous scratch-your-own-itch effort with very little polish. No error handling, liberal copy-paste, vague structure - you know the story. The code obviously involved some parsing and formatting of dates and times. It wasn't very complicated so I avoided the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/datetime.html">big</a> <a href="http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/time.html">guns</a>, sticking to string manipulation and simple arithmetic (figuring out that <em>0830-1030</em> means 120 minutes etc.).</p>
<p>Timesheet entries are fed to JIRA as JSON documents via its REST API. JSON doesn't define a standard timestamp format but examples in the <a href="http://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#id225379">documentation</a> use ISO8601 with a timezone suffix - something like <em>2012-08-14T08:30:00.000+0200</em>. I dutifully slapped on the suffix as a constant to all my outgoing timestamp data.</p>
<p>One of the things I wanted from the script was to detect timesheet entries that were already in JIRA to prevent duplication in the worklogs. This involved downloading the worklog for the relevant issue and comparing it with the entry that was to be uploaded. When parsing timestamps in the worklog I happily ignored the timezone suffix. I figured I would always be in the same timezone as my JIRA server.</p>
<p>After some time I noticed this collision detection was often failing. I had no time to analyze it so I simply took care to upload my timesheet all at once and re-upload only the failed entries if there were errors. It was a pain but still much better than stuffing JIRA manually.</p>
<p>When I got more free time in January I discovered the true nature of the bug. Both me and my JIRA server had effectively switched timezones when the Daylight Savings Time ended in October. The script, however, still had <em>+0200</em> in its outgoing timestamps. This meant that I uploaded an entry with <em>08:30:00.000+0200</em> but then it came back as <em>09:30:00.000+0100</em>. Ignoring the timezone, the script detected no overlap (as long as duration was under 61 minutes) and proceeded to re-upload the entry, again with <em>08:30:00.000+0200</em> in the timestamp.</p>
<p>It turns out that no, I can't ignore timezones in my calculations after all. Besides, the code is already <a href="https://github.com/codingjourney/upsheet">on GitHub</a> and right now collision detection works only for the lucky users who are two hours East from UTC together with their JIRA servers. Good thing I haven't told anyone yet :-)</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

  <div class="entry-content"> <p>My HTPC lived a few months without an update to its <a href="http://www.aptosid.com/">aptosid</a> installation. When I subsequently did perform an update, I ran into some of the same problems I used to have with my Logitech wireless keyboard and iMON remote control. With the help of my <a href="../logitech-dinovo-edge-vs-aptosid.html">previous</a> <a href="../soundgraph-imon-pad-vs-linux-2636.html">blog posts</a>, I was able to set things straight rather quickly.</p>
<p>The solution to my original keyboard problem had been to replace <em>/usr/sbin/hid2hci</em> with a dummy version. In the meantime, <em>/usr/sbin/hid2hci</em> was superseded by <em>/lib/udev/hid2hci</em>. I simply replaced the new file with a dummy version as well.</p>
<p>As for the remote control, the current problem resembled a broken "nomouse" mode of the imon kernel module that I had encountered before. The module seemed to be OK this time, however, so I kept looking and eventually the LIRC manual offered a <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/devinput.html">great description</a> of a LIRC-HAL interaction that seemed to match my symptoms. I tried following the advice from the manual but it just didn't work. It turned out the <em>DEVICE</em> setting in <em>/etc/lirc/hardware.conf</em> had become obsolete. The correct new setting is</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">DEVICE</span><span class="o">=/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">by</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">usb</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">15</span><span class="n">c2_ffdc</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">event</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">if00</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and the remote works like a charm again (for a while, anyway...)</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

  <div class="entry-content"> <p>I'm currently updating a commercial HTML-based desktop application that I wrote a few years ago. Customers keep having permissions trouble on Windows with the back-end opening a TCP port for serving front-end's HTTP requests. I decided to try to refresh both the back-end (to Jetty 7.3.0) and the front-end (to WebKit running in Java via Qt Jambi) and run them in one process with no TCP ports involved. Both components have reputations for being easy to embed, so I thought it shouldn't be too hard. Yeah right...</p>
<p>Actually, things went very smoothly at first. Here's what I discovered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jetty accepts requests via Connectors; one of them is LocalConnector.</li>
<li>Obviously, setting up Jetty with LocalConnector is beyond the scope of this post :-)</li>
<li>LocalConnector.getResponses() accepts a String argument containing an HTTP request just as you would type it into a telnet window (like "GET /whatever HTTP/1.0" followed by two newlines) and returns an HTTP response, also as a String ("HTTP/200 OK blah blah..."). It's a primitive interface but it does work.</li>
<li>The method mentioned above doesn't work very well if you want to GET binary data such as images (yeah, you could use "Content-Encoding: base64" but come on...). There is, fortunately, a variant of LocalConnector.getResponses() that accepts a ByteArrayBuffer along with a boolean "keepOpen" argument which I simply set to false. The method otherwise works just like the String variant.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for a WebKit front-end, once you have Qt Jambi set up properly (with -Djava.library.path etc.) it's really easy to create a QWebView, point it at a URL and splash it all over your display. To prevent HTTP traffic, however, I needed to intercept requests coming from WebKit and route them to my LocalConnector:</p>
<ul>
<li>The thing to do is QWebView.page().setNetworkAccessManager(magic), where "magic" is a subclass of QNetworkAccessManager that overrides createRequest() to do the necessary, well, magic.</li>
<li>Despite superficial appearances, createRequest() actually accepts QNetworkRequest as a parameter and returns a QNetworkReply. Go figure. Additional parameters for createRequest() include an Operation enum to distinguish GETs from POSTs, and a QIODevice (think InputStream) containing the data of a POST request.</li>
<li>Since QNetworkReply is also a stream-like QIODevice, returning custom content from createRequest() involves writing a QNetworkReply subclass that knows where to look for when clients call its read*() methods. This is not quite easy to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway. After a few hours I had a web application running in a WebKit window with not a TCP packet in sight.The trouble came when I tried to process a POST request (yes, the application does involve filling out forms). What followed was a bout of frustration, head-scratching and just plain unhappiness that I don't wish upon anyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you have to realize that Qt Jambi (including its WebKit component) is actually a C++ beast in sheep-like Java clothing. No matter how sweet the API is, the implementation is a bitch to debug even if, technically, you have access to the source code.</li>
<li>What happened is that my createRequest() was called with a PostOperation as it should be but the accompanying QIODevice was empty. More specifically, calling canReadLine() on it returned false.</li>
<li>Setting a breakpoint and examining the QIODevice's internals didn't show anything interesting (it was basically a proxy object for a C++ implementation).</li>
<li>I resorted to the oldest tool in a programmer's toolbox: trace statements. Here's what they gave me:<ul>
<li>formData.isOpen(): true</li>
<li>formData.isReadable(): true</li>
<li>formData.isSequential(): true</li>
<li>formData.atEnd(): true</li>
<li>formData.bytesAvailable(): 0</li>
<li>formData.size(): 0</li>
<li>formData.pos(): 0</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried routing regular HTTP post requests through the parent class and it worked even though the request objects looked exactly the same and returned exactly the same trace results! I was getting ready to give my own QNetworkRequest to the parent implementation that would trace all calls made to it but I tried getByte() and... there was data! WTF?! Point: QNetworkRequest was in a weird uninitialized state where it thought it was empty when it really wasn't. It snapped out of it when prodded for data.</p>
<p>Another problem surfaced when I tried to get a Dojo Tree widget going. During initialization, Dojo loads its modules via AJAX and it was failing with the dreaded "NETWORK_ERR: XmlHttpRequest Exception 101". Cost me a lot of blind paths - I tried setting the .js files in different paths relative to the referring .jsp, reading compressed Dojo sources, diagnosing with window.alert() etc. In the end, I understood that WebKit was having some problem with the QNetworkReply I was producing. I made my Content-Length calculation more robust - no change. Finally, I looked at QNetworkReply objects produced by the regular QNetworkAccessManager and made sure all the attributes it fills out were also filled out in my replies. That helped. I know, I should have done it at the start but why did it matter with AJAX requests and not with regular ones? Oh well...</p>
<p>The AJAX issue turned out to be the last major obstacle. My application now runs without opening any TCP ports and both WebKit and Jetty proved reasonably embeddable. I might use this set-up in other contexts as well.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
