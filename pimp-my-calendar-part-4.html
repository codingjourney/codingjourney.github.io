    <p><a href="./pimp-my-calendar-part-1.html">Previous</a> <a href="./pimp-my-calendar-part-2.html">parts</a> of the <a href="./pimp-my-calendar-part-3.html">saga</a> brought me to a point where I had an upgraded instance of the <a href="http://radicale.org/">Radicale</a> CalDAV server talking to my Android phone's <a href="https://github.com/gggard/AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater">CalDAV adapter</a> and still getting nowhere. I decided to debug the Android-side code.</p>
<p>Attaching the debugger was <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5379129/debugging-not-working-in-a-service-class-what-can-cause-this-issue">a bit of a trick</a> since the adapter has no Activity. Once I got past that, I discovered the response from Radicale was getting parsed just fine but it was only happening in an authentication context (i.e. while adding the new "CalDAV account"). I generally found that the adapter was basically a bunch of callbacks and I seemed unable to properly trigger them.</p>
<p>I then noticed something funny in the log (i.e. the LogCat view in the DDMS perspective in Eclipse):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>VFY: unable to resolve static field 27 (CONTENT_URI) in Landroid/provider/CalendarContract$Events;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/calendar-provider.html">documentation</a>, <em>Events.CONTENT_URI</em> is one of the basic constants used when working with calendars - how could it be missing? The question led to a quick series of discoveries:</p>
<ul>
<li>My phone runs Android 2.3.7 a.k.a. Gingerbread (well, not really a discovery for me but a key piece of the puzzle).</li>
<li>Proper support for non-Google calendars was only added in version 4.0 a.k.a. Ice Cream Sandwich; what there was before was <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/app-builder/programming-with-the-android-40-calendar-api-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/825">unofficial and unsupported</a>.</li>
<li>The CalDAV Adapter project lists API level 14 (Ice Cream Sandwich) as the minimum required API level in its Android manifest.</li>
<li>Back when I first tried to run the CalDAV adapter, Eclipse ADT had told me I had no compatible device; I tried modifying the manifest, changing the minimum API level to 10 (Gingerbread).</li>
<li>Changing the minimum API level of an Android project <em>doesn't trigger a re-build in Eclipse ADT</em>; changing the <em>target API level</em> does trigger a re-build.</li>
<li>Once prompted to re-build the project, ADT flags usage of higher-than-minimum-level APIs as an error, breaking the build.</li>
<li>When Dalvik encounters unknown API usage while executing the code, it marks the block where the API was used as <em>dead code</em> and moves on.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I was trying to use an application that was incompatible with my handset and both the development environment and the runtime responded with silent failures. I think ADT in particular behaved quite impolitely. If using APIs beyond the minimum level is off-limits then changing the minimum level should trigger a re-build, right? As for the Android runtime, the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#min">documentation</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>...the application will crash during runtime when attempting to access the unavailable APIs.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>which seems to be false (or at least no indication of a crash reaches the user). In any case, the approach I'd been taking turned out to be a dead end. <em>Continued in <a href="./pimp-my-calendar-part-5.html">part 5</a>.</em></p>
