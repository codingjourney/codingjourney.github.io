  <div class="entry-content"> <p>I use KDE 4. One of my workspaces is configured with a "dashboard" activity, displaying all the usual monitoring widgets (CPU, RAM, network, temperatures). When my notebook starts acting slow, I hop over to the dashboard to check out my CPU load. If it's high I whip out Konsole and launch <strong>htop</strong> to find the culprit. It has occurred to me that it would really be nice if I could see the CPU hog right away.</p>
<p>I realized there must be a process-monitor plasmoid out there but a Konsole widget seemed so much more flexible. Plasmacon seemed to fit the bill and I had it on the desktop in next to no time. It turned out, however, that it has no facility to launch a command at start-up. I figured it should be easy to extend the widget as it's written in Python. Checking the documentation for Konsole's KPart turned up two promising methods: <strong>sendInput()</strong> and <strong>startProgram()</strong>. Neither of them worked.</p>
<p>I inserted some trace code into Plasmacon's init method and it turned out that the object Plasmacon creates is just a plain <strong>KParts::ReadOnlyPart</strong>. Browsing PyKDE documentation brought the answer: PyKDE doesn't include a binding for kdebase-apps. The upshot is that you can create a <strong>Konsole::Part</strong> instance from Python but you can't access its full API.</p>
<p>Things didn't look so trivial anymore but I decided to have a go at creating the necessary bindings. PyKDE uses a generator called SIP (<strong>apt-get install python-sip</strong> in Debian) to create Python modules from C++ headers and deceptively simple spec files. I tried to write a SIP spec for Konsole starting from <strong>Konsole::Part</strong>'s header file and various <strong>.sip</strong> files I dug up. I have to say SIP provides rather modest feedback. I ended up stuck with a terse "syntax error" message providing no detail at all.</p>
<p>I noticed a little comment in one of the <strong>.sip</strong> files, saying "Generated by twine". Googling for twine proved to be quite a challenge; this is really obscure code used primarily by PyKDE creators and few others. There is no website nor documentation. Another comment in a <strong>.sip</strong> file provided the decisive clue: a mention of "twine2". It brought me to <a href="http://gitorious.org/twine2">http://gitorious.org/twine2</a> where the tool currently seems to live. And yes, it's a generator of input for a generator. Go figure...</p>
<p>Writing a twine2 script seemed quite daunting but I came up with an entirely different approach: what if I could talk to the Konsole via DBus? I quickly discovered <strong>qdbusviewer</strong> and clicked around to see what I could do. Unfortunately, while the <strong>org.kde.plasma-desktop</strong> service does expose a <strong>/Konsole</strong> object, it doesn't provide its Sessions. Some could be found under <strong>org.kde.konsole</strong> but they included strictly sessions in proper Konsole windows; the one in the Plasma widget didn't show up in the list. I had to go back to twine2.</p>
<p>Except I didn't. The ability to delve into the guts of open source software is one of its most useful aspects but there is a limit to how far down the rabbit hole one can reasonably afford to go. I've reached that limit and had to accept that, for the foreseeable future, I will simply not have a process monitor on my dashboard. Worse things have happened.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

  <div class="entry-content"> <p>The new team lead on my current project started using Planning poker for estimation. It turned out that all colleagues except me had installed a corresponding smartphone app in order to avoid mucking about with actual paper cards. The apps are exceedingly simple: all the cards are displayed on the screen, you tap one and it fills the entire screen, you tap it again to restore the initial view. Pretty graphics and fancy animated transitions are just about the only embellishments.</p>
<p>My Fairphone comes without Google Play and I usually fulfill my app needs through F-Droid, the app store dedicated to open source offerings. To my surprise, F-Droid offered no Planning poker app (granted, the store is rather small at about 1000 items). I decided to build my own, of course. Given my current interests, I chose to write it as a HTML5 page instead of a native Android job.</p>
<p>I was done in about 30 minutes and the result was perfectly adequate for the intended purpose. It was pretty spartan, though, so I spent about an hour tweaking the visuals and two more hours adding an animated transition effect. I did all the work in one file without any version control and by the end I wished I had kept track of the various stages. I hadn't done much work in HTML5 before and there was a lot of trial and error involved, especially concerning CSS (I have to thank the friendly spirits at Stackoverflow, MDN and W3C, of course, for speeding up the journey immensely).</p>
<p>And then I found out that I had, in fact, kept all the intermediate versions without even knowing about it! You see, I had set up a shortcut to the Poker page on my Android home screen to speed things up a bit. As it happens, each time I tapped the icon, Firefox opened the page in a new tab. By the time I noticed, I had 60 open tabs. It's a pretty annoying behavior, if you ask me, but in this case it provided a welcome benefit: all iterations of my creation were neatly laid out in chronological order. I only had to save them as separate files.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn't think it would be simple, either. Firefox for Android offers just one "Save as" option: "Save as PDF" which wasn't much use to me as I was after the source code. The Firefox Add-ons page yielded an interesting extension called "View Source Code". I installed it pronto, only to find out that it displayed the source code of the <em>latest</em> version of the file, regardless of which tab I was looking at (all the tabs had the same URL and the extension obviously reloads the source in order to display it).</p>
<p>I tried another extension: "Save as TXT". This one saved only the text visible on the rendered page, of course, which wasn't that useful either. The extension looked rather simple, though, so I downloaded it and poked around in <em>its</em> source code to see if I could adapt it for my purposes. I had had some exposure to the XUL universe before so I wasn't completely confused but even so, the task was far from simple.</p>
<p>My biggest hurdle consisted of the fact that I had to iterate here as well but couldn't restart Firefox in between (lest I lose all my precious tabs!). I found out that uninstalling an extension and installing a newer version of it leaves some hooks registered by the older version in place (something a restart would surely fix) so my changes weren't taking effect. I had to install each new version with a different extension ID, making the whole process pretty cumbersome.</p>
<p>In the end, I bludgeoned the extension into doing what I needed after 8 or 9 iterations. It took two and a half hours and the result was a primitive hack. Having to activate the extension 60x by hand afterwards wasn't much fun either. I did rescue the history of my Planning poker page, however, and that's all that matters.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

  <div class="entry-content"> <p>My HTPC lived a few months without an update to its <a href="http://www.aptosid.com/">aptosid</a> installation. When I subsequently did perform an update, I ran into some of the same problems I used to have with my Logitech wireless keyboard and iMON remote control. With the help of my <a href="../logitech-dinovo-edge-vs-aptosid.html">previous</a> <a href="../soundgraph-imon-pad-vs-linux-2636.html">blog posts</a>, I was able to set things straight rather quickly.</p>
<p>The solution to my original keyboard problem had been to replace <em>/usr/sbin/hid2hci</em> with a dummy version. In the meantime, <em>/usr/sbin/hid2hci</em> was superseded by <em>/lib/udev/hid2hci</em>. I simply replaced the new file with a dummy version as well.</p>
<p>As for the remote control, the current problem resembled a broken "nomouse" mode of the imon kernel module that I had encountered before. The module seemed to be OK this time, however, so I kept looking and eventually the LIRC manual offered a <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/devinput.html">great description</a> of a LIRC-HAL interaction that seemed to match my symptoms. I tried following the advice from the manual but it just didn't work. It turned out the <em>DEVICE</em> setting in <em>/etc/lirc/hardware.conf</em> had become obsolete. The correct new setting is</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">DEVICE</span><span class="o">=/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">by</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">usb</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">15</span><span class="n">c2_ffdc</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">event</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">if00</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and the remote works like a charm again (for a while, anyway...)</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

  <div class="entry-content"> <p>My three-month break from paid programming work was largely spent dealing with various Real Life issues. I did get to try a few things, however, mostly in September in preparation for various interviews. Here's an overview of those experiences for posterity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I started on my first Android app. I was surprised by how rich my own testing feedback was - it substantially changed the whole proposition I'd had in mind. Touch UIs really are a completely different ballgame. That's why I can't see myself developing with emulated devices. I don't worry too much about fragmentation, testing on one specimen of each feasible screen size (say 4.5", 7" and 10"). For a modest app that doesn't use any esoteric hardware features, it seems to be working out OK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I took a look at <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/javaserver-faces-20">JSF 2</a>, <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/contexts-and-dependency">CDI</a> and the rest of the JEE 5 stack (or at least the web profile). I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to deploy a toy application into the various containsers. I tried <a href="http://glassfish.java.net/">GlassFish</a>, <a href="http://tomee.apache.org/apache-tomee.html">TomEE</a> and <a href="https://www.jboss.org/jbossas">JBoss</a>. Especially the latter surprised me as a well-thought-out, approachable piece of software. I even ventured to create a FrankenContainer by mashing up JBoss Weld with Mojarra, Apache OpenEJB, Hibernate JPA etc. That didn't quite work but the few hours of debugging proved amusing.
<br/><br/>
<em>I also used the JEE web profile to implement a basic version of a web app idea I'd had for some time. I deployed to all three containers and there wasn't any issue. I do have to say, though, that I didn't find the experience all that enjoyable. The templating approach taken by JSF 2 is about equally powerful as other mature approaches yet it makes you suffer its baroque verbosity. This became even more apparent when I re-implemented the app in Python (using the <a href="http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pylons-framework/about">Pylons</a> framework and <a href="">Mako</a> templating) to keep my OpenBSD home server free of Java. The Python version is much more compact and has much easier URL manipulation. I suppose JEE comes into its own with really big projects.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was fortunate to play a little with <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/">Apache Wicket</a>, as well. It feels incredibly fresh compared to JEE. I found the binding between the Java and HTML incarnations of a page to be slightly tighter than I'd expected (the component trees have to match pretty much exactly) and I missed an expression language a bit (not wanting to muck around with Velocity integration) but I found myself doing a lot of work very quickly and fluently. Unless the <a href="http://tech.small-improvements.com/2012/01/11/tuning-wicket-session-size/">heavy sessions</a> are a deal-breaker, I find Wicket a pretty obvious choice for writing web apps.
<br/><br/>
<em>Regarding Wicket, I was amused by how varied the Spring integration examples I found turned out to be. One had the standard Wicket servlet with a Spring context starting in the init method of the Application class. Another used a special Spring dispatcher servlet with the Application class as its init parameter. It goes to show that both technologies are well suited for working with other components (in case of Spring that's the whole point, of course). Having multiple ways of doing the same thing is a mixed blessing but what I saw was pretty easy to follow.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wrote a plug-in for the <a href="http://qstardict.ylsoftware.com/index.php">QStarDict</a> desktop dictionary. QStarDict has a really nice <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt</a>-based UI and perfect <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> integration but I found its German-Czech dataset quite useless. I did found a great German-English dataset that ships with <a href="http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~fri/ding/">another tool</a>, though, so I taught QStarDict to parse it. This was my first "major" C++ undertaking since my high-scool project in 1995 so I spent some time scratching my head over things such as namespaces, references and nested template parameters. In the end it all worked out OK. I have to find the time to polish it a bit and talk to the QStarDict folks to see if it's interesting for them.
<br/><br/>
<em>Working with Qt was a pleasure as always, it all looked rather civilized despite the C++. It even made me feel a bit uneasy the way <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/570638/Ten-Cplusplus11-Features-Every-Cplusplus-Developer">C++11</a> does. On the one hand, improved safety and readability are generally worthy goals. On the other, the language should signal its fundamentally unsafe nature. Hiding it too well gives a false sense of safety and it somehow feels hypocritical. I do suppose experienced C++ folks working on large projects simply appreciate all the help they can get.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, for the current project I needed to look into the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Rich_Client_Platform">Eclipse Rich Client Platform</a>. It's not trivial and I'm sure I'll keep discovering new facets for a while. It's really nice to interact with the underlying UI libraries (<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/SWT">SWT</a> and <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/JFace">JFace</a>) simply due to their contrast vis-a-vis <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)">Swing</a>. Exploring a different way of thinking is always useful as well as fascinating.
<br/><br/>
<em>While investigating Eclipse RCP I stumbled upon <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/SWTBot">SWTBot</a>, a functional testing tool for SWT applications. It's not perfect but it seems to be usable. It fits neatly into my toolbox alongside <a href="http://fest.easytesting.org/">FEST</a> and <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
Now that I look at it, the summer wasn't completely wasted after all! I wish I could've delved into some of the topics a little deeper but so is life. I don't like how I've been neglecting the <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/">JavaScript/HTML/CSS</a> universe. I hope I'll make good use of my commute time to fill this void.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
