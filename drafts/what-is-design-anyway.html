  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In high school I wanted to be an industrial designer. At the admissions test to a design college we were asked to propose a packaging design for a floor-cleansing liquid used by professional cleaners rather than consumers. I designed a vessel that was relatively large, well stackable, difficult to topple and had a robust handle easy to operate in protective gloves. It also had a convex shape so that pouring the last drops out of it would be easy. Modeled in clay, it looked somewhat like an obese miniature jerry can.</p>
<p>Needless to say, my application got rejected. I didn't really mind, however. The very fact I was never asked about the rationale behind my design was a good indication the school wasn't the right one for me. The thing is, my idea of a designer was this omnipotent interdisciplinary Product Creator, Guardian of Function and Steward of Conceptual Consistency. I knew even then that was nonsense. Trade magazines of the time (we're talking mid-1990s) did promote such visions but right beside them one could find articles whining "designers get no respect". Product development in the trenches, it seemed, was largely driven by marketing, engineering and random interventions from top management. In this haphazard proces the design department featured somewhere downstream with little more to do than smuggle a bit of ergonomics into a very much constrained whole. Exceptions were few and far between, notably Apple.</p>
