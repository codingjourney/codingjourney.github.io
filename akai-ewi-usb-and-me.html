  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>At the recent <a href="./bratislava-jazz-days-2010.html">Bratislava Jazz Days</a>, I was intrigued by the sight of Marián Jaslovský of Silvia Fourporation playing the <a href="http://www.akaipro.com/ewi4000s">Akai EWI 4000s</a> electronic wind instrument. I used to play tenor saxophone as a hobby but I put it on hold a few years ago mainly due to the fact I had no way of practicing without disturbing the neighbors (I live in an apartment). The EWI seemed like a great way around that as it can be listened to via earphones. I had considered buying one before but I was put off by the expense. With my interest now re-kindled, I looked into the matter again and found the prices much more likeable. Crucially, I discovered the new <a href="http://www.akaipro.com/ewiusb">USB variant</a>.</p>
<p>The difference between the older 4000s and the USB model boils down to the latter being strictly a MIDI peripheral for a computer. It has no audio output (i.e. no built-in synthesizer) and it's powered only via its USB connection. Compared to its older sibling, the EWI USB is a no-fuss, light, inexpensive affair. Still, it is by no means a toy. It features a robustly built body with virtually no moving parts (there are touch-sensitive metallic pads instead of keys) and the sound one can produce is only limited by the quality of the synthesizer the instrument is plugged into.</p>
<p>Having spent some time with the unit since I purchased it, I must say I'm thoroughly satisfied. It feels very natural in my hands. The mouthpiece is completely different from the saxophone but I knew I wasn't going to replicate the experience perfectly anyway. The tactile feedback is different as well since the "keys" don't move but I find the experience very much similar to what I was used to. Touching a pad feels just like finishing a key-press in that there is a definite, solid limit to the motion of the finger. And when I set the software synthesizer to the right sound it really does feel just like an acoustic wind instrument, albeit not a saxophone. The feeling is quite thrilling and has to be experienced to be believed.</p>
<p>There are quirks as well, of course. The instrument cannot be simply picked up and played - I have to uncoil the cables, plug the USB cable into the EWI, plug the other end into my notebook, plug in the headphones - oh, and boot the notebook and log in, obviously. So there is a "transaction cost" to every session, one cannot just pick the thing up for five relaxing minutes. This would be different if I had a dedicated netbook just for the EWI as many people seem to prefer (especially those who also perform) but I don't really mind. I need hundreds of hours of practice to get back into form, anyway.</p>
<p>Another difficulty is the mouthpiece which puts up a lot of resistance. I once tried playing an oboe and this feels similar - it takes more energy to push air through the mouthpiece than was the case with my saxophone. I believe this is something I simply need to get used to but right now I often end up out of breath.</p>
<p>One last quibble I have with the instrument is the feeble neckstrap that simply doesn't do it justice. I already had to mend it with superglue. But that's really a minor point and I'm sure most wind players will have a quality neckstrap lying around.</p>
<p>One thing I haven't mentioned is the veritable odyssey involved in making the thing work with my computer. I use Linux so I knew it wouldn't be that easy; it wasn't and there are still a few details to work out. That's a topic for another post, however. My main point for now: the EWI wants to be played. When I come home from work and look at it I immediately feel like picking it up and taking a few practice runs. I find that simply priceless.</p>
