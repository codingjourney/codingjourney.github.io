  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>After a protracted investigation spanning several days (see <a href="./alice-in-printerland.html">part 1</a>, <a href="./the-battle-of-the-c5280-part-1.html">part 2</a>, <a href="./the-battle-of-the-c5280-part-2.html">part 3</a> and <a href="./the-battle-of-the-c5280-part-3.html">part 4</a>), my new home server is finally providing access to my HP Photosmart C5280 printer-scanner combo. The basic goal has been achieved but I cannot be very happy with the end result. To get the printer to work, I had to disable the <em>ulpt</em> and <em>umass</em> USB drivers in the server's OpenBSD 5.2 kernel - they were both being assigned to the device along with the <em>ugen</em> driver the system actually wanted to talk to.</p>
<p>Granted, the <em>ulpt</em> driver is largely superfluous when the printer works with <em>ugen</em> (though I can imagine having another USB printer to which I'd want to print through a service other than CUPS that would specifically need <em>ulpt</em>). Disabling <em>umass</em> is more serious. As it happens, my home server needs no USB storage at the moment but that could change in the future, putting me in a difficult spot. I don't think this is an acceptable state of affairs in the long term, especially when the previous home server running OpenBSD 4.8 exhibits no such limitations.</p>
<p>Regarding the effort it took me to get to this point, it was largely a function of my insistence on figuring things out on my own. I do enjoy this sort of detective work from time to time and I did learn a bunch of new things so it was definitely time well spent. Truly resolving the issue is beyond my capacity, however. It's a task for OpenBSD hackers who know their way around USB plumbing.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> <em>The issue has been <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/devel/libusb1/patches/patch-libusb_os_openbsd_usb_c?only_with_tag=OPENBSD_5_3">fixed</a> in OpenBSD 5.3 which was released on May 1, 2013.</em></p>
