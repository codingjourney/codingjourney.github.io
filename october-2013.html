  <h3>About the blog</h3>
  A platform to practice my written communication skills.
  The range of topics tends to surprise even myself.

  My name is Ján Hušták. I live in

  I've been developing software professionally since 1998.
  The Java platform has served me well but I don't dwell on it.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>30 June 2013 marked the conclusion of a successful co-operation between myself and an important client. My involvement in the project had lasted almost 6 years and I felt it was time to move on. Having handed over my responsibilities, I'm enjoying a three-month hiatus and plan to start another engagement in October.</p>
<h4>What's on offer</h4>
<p>As it says in the sidebar, I'm mostly a Java guy with 15 years of experience. The details are in my CV (<a href="./static/snippets/jan_hustak_cv_201307.doc">doc</a> or <a href="./static/snippets/jan_hustak_cv_201307.odt">odt</a>) but I don't think a CV can convey what really matters.</p>
<p>I believe I have good analytical and problem-solving skills. I appreciate the complexities of requirement gathering and  the value of customer feedback. I always consider the usability impacts of my design decisions. I understand that IT is not a cure-all and that true solutions to many problems are actually non-technical.</p>
<p>I'm keenly aware of the <a href="http://blogs.uw.edu/ajko/2012/08/22/john-carmack-discusses-the-art-and-science-of-software-engineering/">social nature</a> and the inherent <a href="http://nathanmarz.com/blog/principles-of-software-engineering-part-1.html">uncertainties</a> of software development. I crave good <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Craftsmanship.html">craftsmanship</a> and wish there were more of it in our industry. I recognize the importance of great tools and take time to learn them properly. I'm always willing to reconsider my opinions but I'm also capable of defending them - always in a friendly and civil manner.</p>
<h4>What I'm looking for</h4>
<p>I hope to join a team of developers who care about the quality of their output. I like a developer culture with emphasis on knowledge sharing, learning and improvement. That implies open and constructive communication. Agile practices are a plus as long as they're implemented consequently.</p>
<p>I'd love to work on stuff that matters. I'm especially interested in renewable energy, smart grid and energy efficiency, but also medical software, education or any other world-changing area I haven't thought of. Having said that, any software is worth working on as long as it improves the lives of its users or their customers.</p>
<p>I'm largely geographically constrained to Europe (ideally somewhere around Vienna) but a really great offer might tempt me overseas. I'm keen to try teleworking - huge open-source projects come from dispersed teams so it's got to be feasible. Hybrid models are also an option (3 weeks at home, 1 week on-site etc.).</p>
<h4>If you're interested</h4>
<p>Do write me a quick note - <em>coding 'at' journey 'dot' sk</em>.</p>
